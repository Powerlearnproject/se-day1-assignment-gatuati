Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry. 

It is a discipline that applies engineering principles to the design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance of software systems.
the importance is to ensure the creation of quality and efficient systems.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

1. The Birth of Software Engineering (1968) - This milestone emphasized the need for structured software development methodologies
2. The Rise of Structured Programming (1970s) - This era led to the development of programming languages such as C
3. The Emergence of Agile Methodologies  - it enabled faster  adaptability to changes, and improved software quality.
   
List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

1. Requirement Analysis – Gathering  requirements based on stakeholder needs.
2. Planning – Defining project scope.
3. Design – Creating software architecture.
4. Implementation (Coding) – Writing the actual source code based on design documents.
5. Testing – Verifying software functionality, fixing bugs, and ensuring it meets requirements.
6. Deployment – Releasing the software for users.
7. Maintenance & Support – fixing bugs, and updating software over time.
   
Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

waterfall is linear and sequential while agile is itearative. waterfall should be used where the project is well defined while agile should be used in projects that may require frequent changes and updates e.g systems

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

the software engineer writes and develops the code
quality assurance engineer executes the test cases
project manager oversees the project execution

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

iDE'S provide an interface for coding and debugging
version control systems tracks changes in code overtime and manages them

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

fixing bugs- implement testing
keeping up with upcoming trends - continously learn and research
deadlines - come up with a schedule and integrate an agile method

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1. unit - tests individual components
2. integration - tests the interactions between softwares
3. system - tests the whole system
4. acceptance - tests to validate the system

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

writing instructions to an AI to get the desired output. importance of prompt engineering is that it improves efficiency and accuracy of the response.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

'explain about williams drivers in F1 and tell me about their interview' -> ' explain to me about driver number 55 Carlos Sainz and number 23 Alex Albon who drive
for Williams in F1 and tell me about their F175 interview'. The improved prompt is effective in that it will give me snippets of both drivers words in the interview which i specified not just a random one.
